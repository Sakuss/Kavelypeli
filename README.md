# Kävelypeli
This project has been implemented by the second-year students of the Information technology degree program at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. This application measures and displays steps in a fun way and encourages especially young people to move. The user can, for example, collect points, buy accessories for the character, unlock achievements, and monitor the activity of friends.
